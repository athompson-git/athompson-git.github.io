A network of Kevlar ropes supports and constrains the balloon. The liquid scintillator is 80% dodecane, 20% pseudocumene (1,2,4-trimethylbenzene), and 1.52 g/liter of PPO (2,5-diphenyloxazole) used as a fluor. A buffer mixture of dodecane and isoparaffin oils fills the volume b etween the balloon and the 18-m-diameter spherical stainless-steel containment vessel. The entire inner sur face of the vessel is covered by an array of a total of 1879 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), 1325 of which ar e specially developed 17-in. and 554 of which are the old Kamiokande 20-in. devices. The total photocathode coverage is 34 %. The containment vessel is surrounded by a 3.2 kton water-Cherenkov detector. The data taking has been continuing since January 22, 2002.",
