        "Notes": "Gravitational waves offer a remarkable opportunity to see the universe from a new perspective, providing access to astrophysical insights that are available in no other way. The initial LIGO gravitational wave detectors have completed observations with their original design sensitivity, and the data have been interpreted to establish new upper limits on gravitational-wave flux. Another science run with modest improvements to the sensitivity is planned for the coming months. The sensitivity of the initial LIGO instruments is such that it is perfectly possible that discoveries will be made. If they succeed, there will be a strong demand from the community to improve the sensitivity allowing more astrophysical information to be recovered from the signals. If no discovery is made, there will be no lesser urgency to improve the sensitivity of the instrument to the point where there is a general consensus that gravitational waves will be detected often and with a good signal-to-noise ratio. The development of the next generation of instrument must be pursued aggressively to make the transition from the initial to the Advanced detector in a timely way - after the complete science run of the initial detector, but as quickly as possible thereafter. The Advanced LIGO detector upgrade meets these requirements for an instrument that will establish gravitational-wave astronomy. It is more than ten times more sensitive, and over a much broader frequency band, than initial LIGO. It can see a volume of space more than a thousand times greater than initial LIGO, and extends the range of compact masses that can be observed at a fixed signal strength by a factor of four or more.",

        "Notes": "The primary objective of the LISA mission is to detect and study in detail gravitational wave signals from sources involving massive black holes (MBH's). This includes both transient signals from the terminal stages of binary coalescences, which we will call bursts, and binary signals which are continuous over the observation period. The scientific information obtainable from such sources, both for astrophysics and for testing current predictions of gravitational theory, is enormous. The main issues are whether the bursts occur frequently enough so that a number of them can be observed over the mission lifetime, and whether the stronger continuous signals can be observed over the instrumental and other noise limitations. Most of the burst signals would be observable with high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) out to large red shifts. Other important objectives also exist. LISA will certainly observe distinguishable signals from thousands of binary systems containing compact stars, and be able to determine the number and distribution of such binaries in our galaxy. The directions to the sources can be determined from the amplitude and phase changes of the signals during the year. At frequencies below about 3 mHz the number of galactic binaries will be large enough to interfere with the observation of some important extragalactic sources. Signals from some known binary systems are also likely to be seen. In addition, a useful search for a continuous spectrum of gravitational radiation generated at early times would be carried out. The expected LISA sensitivity and the signal levels of several expected sources are indicated in the figure below.",

In order to do this, we are performing long-term timing observations and analysis on an array of pulsar systems scattered across the sky. The coalescence of primordial black holes - during galaxy mergers, for example - should form a stochastic background of gravitational waves permeating the Universe.
